<h1>Project Plan</h1>

<h2>Mini Site 2 - Trainning Zone</h2>

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>

<p>Summarise what the project is and why (purpose) in one or two concise paragraphs. Note that the mission must be to improve something in a measurable way.
To "provide information about something" is not a good mission, since you can't see a measurable improvement. Why is the site needed?</p>

<h4>Success Evaluation</h4>

<p>Discuss the process(es) by which the site's success will be evaluated. Note that a "hit counter" only counts people (or robots) visiting your web site; it says nothing about whether the site has achieved its mission. How do you know that the site does what the client wanted? Measure the mission.</p>

<h5>Target Audience</h5>

<p>Describe the target audience your site is intended for (be specific; you can't aim for "everyone"), why they were chosen and how you will specifically design the site to cater to them.</p>
<h6>Site Flowchart (Structure Diagram)</h6>
<p>Insert image here (GIF or PNG are normally the best format choice if doing a plain, straight-lined diagram). Use arrows to show link direction. You might consider using draw.io if you don't have a preferred flowchart drawing program.</p>
